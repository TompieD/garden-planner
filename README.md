## Description

*How does your garden grow?*

Oh, not sure yet? Well, let's fix that. Our application is dedicated to those seeking to learn about gardening. Personalize your garden by adding what you're growing from our plant database. After adding your plants to your garden, you can access the specific needs of each of your plants.
Need a little motivation on what to grow? Well, that's what the community is for! Once you're signed up, you have access to see what other gardeners are growing.
Our application is a simple tool for beginner gardeners to build their own garden and connect with those that already have!
