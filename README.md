## Description

_*How does your garden grow?*_

Oh, not sure yet? Well, let's fix that. Our application is dedicated to those seeking to learn about gardening. Personalize your garden by adding what you're growing from our plant database. After adding your plants to your garden, you can access the specific needs of each of your plants.
Need a little motivation on what to grow? Well, that's what the community is for! Once you're signed up, you have access to see what other gardeners are growing.
Our application is a simple tool for beginner gardeners to build their own garden and connect with those that already have! 

## Challenge Criteria 

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

- Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
